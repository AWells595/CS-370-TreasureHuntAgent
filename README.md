# CS-370-TreasureHuntAgent
For this project the goal was to create and train a machine learning model to navigate a given maze and find the treasure at the end. I was given code to score the games, generate the layers for the model, create the map, and use experience replay. I created the training algoritm to teach the model how to complete its task efficently and with a 100% win rate. 

# What do computer scientists do?
A computer scientist is someone who is trying to research and push the bounds of what computers and technology is capable of. This is an imporant role that has many knock on effects for society espeically as we continue to become more and more reliant on computers.

# How do I approach a problem as a compuiter scienitst
As a computer scientist I approach a problem by first thinking of what exactly the problem is, sometimes by reasoning sometimes by asking claryfing questions. Then I break the problem down into smaller problems that are easier to solve. Once I solve the smaller problems I can then link the solutions together to solve the original complex problem.

# Ethical responsibilites to end user and the organization
To the end user I have an ethical responibility to only collect as much data as is necessary to provide a good user experience. I must also safeguard this data from malicous actors. I also have a responsibility to provide a good bug free user experinece. To the organization I have a responsibility to deliver high quality code in a reasonable timeframe that is relatively bug free. I also have a responbility to the organization to ensure that code I write is secure and cannot be used as a future attack vector
